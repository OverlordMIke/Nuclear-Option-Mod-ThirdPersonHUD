**A client-side mod that improves the Orbit camera experience in Nuclear Option.**

![Game Banner or Screenshot](preview_screenshot.png)  

## About

This mod fixes a common annoyance in **Orbit camera mode** (external view):
- The in-cockpit **HUD** is now properly visible while flying in Orbit camera.
- The **horizon line** and **pitch increment lines** are automatically hidden to reduce screen clutter and improve visibility.

Once installed, the mod is **enabled by default**. You can toggle or fine-tune it anytime via the auto-generated config file.

## Features

- **HUD visibility in Orbit camera** — See your full situational awareness HUD (velocity vector, AoA, G-load, radar contacts, etc.) even when using external Orbit view.
- **Reduced clutter** — Horizon line + pitch ladder automatically disabled in Orbit mode for a cleaner screen.

## Requirements

- [Nuclear Option](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2168680/Nuclear_Option/) (Steam)
- [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (latest pack for Unity Mono games — usually drop the BepInEx folder into your game directory)

## Installation

1. Install **BepInEx** if you haven't already:
   - Download the appropriate pack from the [BepInEx GitHub releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases).
   - Extract it so `BepInEx` folder is directly inside your Nuclear Option install directory (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Nuclear Option\`).
   - Launch the game once — BepInEx will generate its folders.

2. Download the latest release of this mod from the [Releases page](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/YourModName/releases).

3. Extract the contents of the zip file into the BepInEx/plugins folder.
